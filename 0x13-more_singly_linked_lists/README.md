# 0x13. C - More Singly Linked Lists

## Overview
Welcome to the "0x13. C - More Singly Linked Lists" project! This project builds upon the concepts introduced in the previous "0x12. C - Singly linked lists" project. Here, we delve deeper into developing data structures using singly linked lists in the C programming language.

## Project Contents
This repository houses a collection of C files that implement a variety of operations on singly linked lists. These operations include adding, deleting, searching, and displaying elements in the linked lists.

## Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
